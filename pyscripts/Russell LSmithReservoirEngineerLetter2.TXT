RE: Petroleum Engineer

Dear ,

Throughout my career, I have contributed to impacting business outcomes through effective organization, prioritization, and execution of key projects. My skills and qualifications are an ideal match to the Reservoir Engineer requirements and will bring immediate value to BP.

Previously, in my Consultant Engineer role, I exercised a calculated and methodical approach to problem solving. I am independently motivated, yet I appreciate team efforts and collaborate productively within groups. Additionally, I am knowledgeable in interpreting drilling and testing data and data analysis with proficiency in estimating production capabilities.

Because my professional experience align with BP's values, this opportunity is especially exciting. I believe my problem-solving, leadership and decision-making abilities will support and drive your continued organizational success.

In my previous role I was a skilled and hardworking Reservoir Engineer, but due to the ongoing pandemic my previous employer was forced to lay off many employees. While this period was unplanned and unexpected, I put the time to good use and am ready to get back to the workforce.

To demonstrate the scope of my career history and professional competencies, please take a moment to review my attached resume. I appreciate your evaluation of my credentials and subsequent response. 
Sincerely,
Russell L Smith
